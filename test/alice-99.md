### Epigraph

## All in the Golden Afternoon

> All in the golden afternoon \
> &emsp;Full leisurely we glide; \
> For both our oars, with little skill, \
> &emsp;By little arms are plied; \
> While little hands make vain pretence \
> &emsp;Our wanderings to guide.
>
> Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour, \
> &emsp;Beneath such dreamy weather, \
> To beg a tale of breath too weak\
> &emsp;To stir the tiniest feather! \
> Yet what can one poor voice avail \
> &emsp;Against three tongues together?
>
> Imperious Prima flashes forth \
> &emsp;Her edict “to begin it”: \
> In gentler tones Secunda hopes \
> &emsp;“There will be nonsense in it.” \
> While Tertia interrupts the tale \
> &emsp;Not _more_ than once a minute.
>
> Anon, to sudden silence won, \
> &emsp;In fancy they pursue \
> The dream-child moving through a land \
> &emsp;Of wonders wild and new, \
> In friendly chat with bird or beast⁠ — \
> &emsp;And half believe it true.
>
> And ever, as the story drained \
> &emsp;The wells of fancy dry, \
> And faintly strove that weary one \
> &emsp;To put the subject by, \
> “The rest next time⁠—” “It _is_ next time!” \
> &emsp;The happy voices cry.
>
> Thus grew the tale of Wonderland: \
> &emsp;Thus slowly, one by one, \
> Its quaint events were hammered out⁠ — \
> &emsp;And now the tale is done, \
> And home we steer, a merry crew, \
> &emsp;Beneath the setting sun.
>
> Alice! A childish story take, \
> &emsp;And with a gentle hand \
> Lay it where Childhood’s dreams are twined \
> &emsp;In Memory’s mystic band, \
> Like pilgrim’s withered wreath of flowers \
> &emsp;Pluck’d in a far-off land.
