The Lobster Quadrille</h3><p>The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. \u201CSame as if he had a bone in his throat,\u201D said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:\u2060 \u2014</p><p>\u201CYou may not have lived much under the sea\u2060 \u2014\u201D (\u201CI haven\u2019t,\u201D said Alice)\u2060 \u2014\u201Cand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster\u2060 \u2014\u201D (Alice began to say \u201CI once tasted\u2060 \u2014\u201D but checked herself hastily, and said \u201CNo, never\u201D) \u201C\u2060\u2014 so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, indeed,\u201D said Alice. \u201CWhat sort of a dance is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy,\u201D said the Gryphon, \u201Cyou first form into a line along the seashore \u2060\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CTwo lines!\u201D cried the Mock Turtle. \u201CSeals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you\u2019ve cleared all the jellyfish out of the way \u2060\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201C<em>That</em> generally takes some time,\u201D interrupted the Gryphon.</p><p>\u201C\u2060\u2014 you advance twice\u2060 \u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CEach with a lobster as a partner!\u201D cried the Gryphon.</p><p>\u201COf course,\u201D the Mock Turtle said: \u201Cadvance twice, set to partners\u2060 \u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2060\u2014 change lobsters, and retire in same order,\u201D continued the Gryphon.</p><p>\u201CThen, you know,\u201D the Mock Turtle went on, \u201Cyou throw the \u2060\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe lobsters!\u201D shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</p><p>\u201C\u2060\u2014 as far out to sea as you can\u2060 \u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CSwim after them!\u201D screamed the Gryphon.</p><p>\u201CTurn a somersault in the sea!\u201D cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.</p><p>\u201CChange lobsters again!\u201D yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</p><p>\u201CBack to land again, and that\u2019s all the first figure,\u201D said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</p><p>\u201CIt must be a very pretty dance,\u201D said Alice timidly.</p><p>\u201CWould you like to see a little of it?\u201D said the Mock Turtle.</p><p>\u201CVery much indeed,\u201D said Alice.</p><p>\u201CCome, let\u2019s try the first figure!\u201D said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. \u201CWe can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\u201D</p>',22),d=e("<p>\u201COh, <em>you</em> sing,\u201D said the Gryphon. \u201CI\u2019ve forgotten the words.\u201D</p><p>So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:\u2060 \u2014</p><blockquote><p>\u201C\u200A\u2018Will you walk a little faster?\u2019 said a whiting to a snail.<br> \u2018There\u2019s a porpoise close behind us, and he\u2019s treading on my tail.<br><br> See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!<br> They are waiting on the shingle \u2060\u2014 will you come and join the dance?<br><br> Will you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, will you join the dance?<br> Will you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, won\u2019t you join the dance?<br><br> You can really have no notion how delightful it will be,<br> When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\u2019<br> But the snail replied \u2018Too far, too far!\u2019 and gave a look askance\u2060 \u2014<br> Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.<br><br> Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.<br> Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.<br><br> \u2018What matters it how far we go?\u2019 his scaly friend replied.<br> \u2018There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.<br> The further off from England the nearer is to France\u2060 \u2014<br> Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.<br><br> Will you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, will you join the dance?<br> Will you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, won\u2019t you join the dance?\u2019\u200A\u201D</p></blockquote><p>\u201CThank you, it\u2019s a very interesting dance to watch,\u201D said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: \u201Cand I do so like that curious song about the whiting!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, as to the whiting,\u201D said the Mock Turtle, \u201Cthey\u2060 \u2014 you\u2019ve seen them, of course?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes,\u201D said Alice, \u201CI\u2019ve often seen them at dinn\u2060 \u2014\u201D she checked herself hastily.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t know where Dinn may be,\u201D said the Mock Turtle, \u201Cbut if you\u2019ve seen them so often, of course you know what they\u2019re like.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI believe so,\u201D Alice replied thoughtfully. \u201CThey have their tails in their mouths\u2060 \u2014 and they\u2019re all over crumbs.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re wrong about the crumbs,\u201D said the Mock Turtle: \u201Ccrumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they <em>have</em> their tails in their mouths; and the reason is \u2060\u2014\u201D here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.\u2060 \u2014 \u201CTell her about the reason and all that,\u201D he said to the Gryphon.</p><p>\u201CThe reason is,\u201D said the Gryphon, \u201Cthat they <em>would</em> go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn\u2019t get them out again. That\u2019s all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you,\u201D said Alice, \u201Cit\u2019s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can tell you more than that, if you like,\u201D said the Gryphon. \u201CDo you know why it\u2019s called a whiting?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI never thought about it,\u201D said Alice. \u201CWhy?\u201D</p><p>\u201C<em>It does the boots and shoes.</em>\u201D the Gryphon replied very solemnly.</p><p>Alice was thoroughly puzzled. \u201CDoes the boots and shoes!\u201D she repeated in a wondering tone.</p><p>\u201CWhy, what are <em>your</em> shoes done with?\u201D said the Gryphon. \u201CI mean, what makes them so shiny?\u201D</p><p>Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. \u201CThey\u2019re done with blacking, I believe.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBoots and shoes under the sea,\u201D the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, \u201Care done with a whiting. Now you know.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd what are they made of?\u201D Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.</p><p>\u201CSoles and eels, of course,\u201D the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: \u201Cany shrimp could have told you that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf I\u2019d been the whiting,\u201D said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, \u201CI\u2019d have said to the porpoise, \u2018Keep back, please: we don\u2019t want <em>you</em> with us!\u2019\u200A\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey were obliged to have him with them,\u201D the Mock Turtle said: \u201Cno wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWouldn\u2019t it really?\u201D said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</p><p>\u201COf course not,\u201D said the Mock Turtle: \u201Cwhy, if a fish came to <em>me</em>, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \u2018With what porpoise?\u2019\u200A\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t you mean \u2018purpose\u2019?\u201D said Alice.</p><p>\u201CI mean what I say,\u201D the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added, \u201CCome, let\u2019s hear some of <em>your</em> adventures.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI could tell you my adventures\u2060 \u2014 beginning from this morning,\u201D said Alice a little timidly: \u201Cbut it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\u201D</p><p>\u201CExplain all that,\u201D said the Mock Turtle.</p><p>\u201CNo, no! The adventures first,\u201D said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \u201Cexplanations take such a dreadful time.\u201D</p><p>So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so <em>very</em> wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating \u201CYou are old, Father William,\u201D to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said, \u201CThat\u2019s very curious.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s all about as curious as it can be,\u201D said the Gryphon.</p><p>\u201CIt all came different!\u201D the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \u201CI should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.\u201D He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</p><p>\u201CStand up and repeat \u2018\u200A<em>\u2019Tis the voice of the sluggard</em>,\u2019\u200A\u201D said the Gryphon.</p><p>\u201CHow the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\u201D thought Alice; \u201CI might as well be at school at once.\u201D However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:\u2060 \u2014</p>",34),u=e("<blockquote><p>\u201C\u200A\u2019Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,<br> \u2003\u2018You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\u2019<br> As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose<br> \u2003Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\u201D</p><p>When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,<br> \u2003And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,<br> But when the tide rises and sharks are around,<br> \u2003His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.</p></blockquote><p>\u201CThat\u2019s different from what I used to say when I was a child,\u201D said the Gryphon.</p><p>\u201CWell, I never heard it before,\u201D said the Mock Turtle; \u201Cbut it sounds uncommon nonsense.\u201D</p><p>Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would <em>ever</em> happen in a natural way again.</p><p>\u201CI should like to have it explained,\u201D said the Mock Turtle.</p><p>\u201CShe can\u2019t explain it,\u201D said the Gryphon hastily. \u201CGo on with the next verse.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut about his toes?\u201D the Mock Turtle persisted. \u201CHow <em>could</em> he turn them out with his nose, you know?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s the first position in dancing,\u201D Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.</p><p>\u201CGo on with the next verse,\u201D the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \u201Cit begins \u2018I passed by his garden.\u2019\u200A\u201D</p><p>Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:\u2060 \u2014</p><blockquote><p>\u201CI passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,<br> \u2003How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie\u2060 \u2014<br> The Panther took piecrust, and gravy, and meat,<br> \u2003While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.<br> When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,<br> \u2003Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:<br> While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,<br> \u2003And concluded the banquet\u2060 \u2014\u201D</p></blockquote><p>\u201CWhat <em>is</em> the use of repeating all that stuff,\u201D the Mock Turtle interrupted, \u201Cif you don\u2019t explain it as you go on? It\u2019s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I think you\u2019d better leave off,\u201D said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.</p><p>\u201CShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\u201D the Gryphon went on. \u201COr would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\u201D Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, \u201CHm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \u2018Turtle Soup,\u2019 will you, old fellow?\u201D</p><p>The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:\u2060 \u2014</p><blockquote><p>\u201CBeautiful Soup, so rich and green,<br> Waiting in a hot tureen!<br> Who for such dainties would not stoop?<br> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!<br> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!<br> \u2003Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!<br> \u2003Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!<br> Soo\u2060\u2014oop of the e-e-evening,<br> \u2003Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</p><p>\u201CBeautiful Soup!
