Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201D (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p><p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p><hr><p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p><p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u201C<strong>Orange Marmalade</strong>,\u201D but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p><p>\u201CWell!\u201D thought Alice to herself, \u201Cafter such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u201D (Which was very likely true.)</p><p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em> come to an end! \u201CI wonder how many miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201D she said aloud. \u201CI must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think\u2060 \u2014 \u201D (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a <em>very</em> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u201C\u2060\u2014 yes, that\u2019s about the right distance \u2060\u2014 but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201D (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p><p>Presently she began again. \u201CI wonder if I shall fall right <em>through</em> the earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think \u2060\u2014\u201D (she was rather glad there <em>was</em> no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u201C\u2060\u2014 but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201D (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke \u2060\u2014 fancy curtseying as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201CAnd what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201D</p><p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \u201CDinah\u2019ll miss me very much tonight, I should think!\u201D (Dinah was the cat.) \u201CI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at teatime. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201D And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u201CDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201D and sometimes, \u201CDo bats eat cats?\u201D for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201CNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201D when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p><hr><p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201COh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201D She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p><p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p><p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.

First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u201Cfor it might end, you know,\u201D said Alice to herself, \u201Cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\u201D And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p><p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p><p>\u201CCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201D said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u201CI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201D She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. \u201CBut it\u2019s no use now,\u201D thought poor Alice, \u201Cto pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make <em>one</em> respectable person!\u201D</p><p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u201C<strong>Eat Me</strong>\u201D were beautifully marked in currants. \u201CWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201D said Alice, \u201Cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201D</p><p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u201CWhich way? Which way?\u201D, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p><p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>",9),I='{"title":"Down the Rabbit-Hole","description":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Down the Rabbit-Hole"},"headers":[{"level":3,"title":"I.
