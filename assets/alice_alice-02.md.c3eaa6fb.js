The Pool of Tears",-1),w=s("<p>\u201CCuriouser and curiouser!\u201D cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u201Cnow I\u2019m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Goodbye, feet!\u201D (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). \u201COh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m sure <em>I</em> shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2060 \u2014 but I must be kind to them,\u201D thought Alice, \u201Cor perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\u201D</p><p>And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u201CThey must go by the carrier,\u201D she thought; \u201Cand how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending presents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!</p><blockquote><p>Alice\u2019s Right Foot, Esq.<br> \u2003Hearthrug,<br> \u2003\u2003Near the Fender,<br> \u2003\u2003\u2003(With Alice\u2019s Love).</p></blockquote><p>Oh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201D</p><p>Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p><p>Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.</p><p>\u201CYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201D said Alice, \u201Ca great girl like you,\u201D (she might well say this), \u201Cto go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!\u201D But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.</p><p>After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201COh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! <em>won\u2019t</em> she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201D Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of anyone; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201CIf you please, sir \u2060\u2014\u201D The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.</p>",8),c=s("<p>Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u201CDear, dear! How queer everything is today! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I\u2019ve been changed in the night? Let me think: <em>was</em> I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I\u2019m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that\u2019s the great puzzle!\u201D And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not Ada,\u201D she said, \u201Cfor her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn\u2019t go in ringlets at all; and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, <em>she\u2019s</em> she, and I\u2019m I, and\u2060 \u2014 oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I\u2019ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2060 \u2014 oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\u2019t signify: let\u2019s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome \u2060\u2014 no, that\u2019s all wrong, I\u2019m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I\u2019ll try and say \u2018How doth the little \u2060\u2014\u2019\u200A\u201D and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:\u2060\u2014</p><blockquote><p>\u201CHow doth the little crocodile<br> \u2003Improve his shining tail,<br> And pour the waters of the Nile<br> \u2003On every golden scale!</p><p>\u201CHow cheerfully he seems to grin,<br> \u2003How neatly spread his claws,<br> And welcome little fishes in<br> \u2003<em>With gently smiling jaws!</em>\u201D</p></blockquote><p>\u201CI\u2019m sure those are not the right words,\u201D said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \u201CI must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\u2019ve made up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here! It\u2019ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \u2018Come up again, dear!\u2019 I shall only look up and say \u2018Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down here till I\u2019m somebody else\u2019 \u2060\u2014 but, oh dear!\u201D cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \u201CI do wish they <em>would</em> put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!\u201D</p><p>As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while she was talking. \u201CHow <em>can</em> I have done that?\u201D she thought. \u201CI must be growing small again.\u201D She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p><p>\u201CThat <em>was</em> a narrow escape!\u201D said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \u201Cand now for the garden!\u201D and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \u201Cand things are worse than ever,\u201D thought the poor child, \u201Cfor I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it\u2019s too bad, that it is!\u201D</p><p>As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, \u201Cand in that case I can go back by railway,\u201D she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.</p>",7),m=s("<p>\u201CI wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u201D said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. \u201CI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That <em>will</em> be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer today.\u201D</p><p>Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p><p>\u201CWould it be of any use, now,\u201D thought Alice, \u201Cto speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying.\u201D So she began: \u201CO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\u201D (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u201CA mouse \u2060\u2014 of a mouse\u2060 \u2014 to a mouse \u2060\u2014 a mouse\u2060 \u2014 O mouse!\u201D The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.</p><p>\u201CPerhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u201D thought Alice; \u201CI daresay it\u2019s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u201D (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: \u201COu est ma chatte?\u201D which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \u201COh, I beg your pardon!\u201D cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings. \u201CI quite forgot you didn\u2019t like cats.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot like cats!\u201D cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u201CWould <em>you</em> like cats if you were me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, perhaps not,\u201D said Alice in a soothing tone: \u201Cdon\u2019t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,\u201D Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, \u201Cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face \u2060\u2014 and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse\u2060 \u2014 and she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice \u2060\u2014 oh, I beg your pardon!\u201D cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \u201CWe won\u2019t talk about her any more if you\u2019d rather not.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe indeed!\u201D cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. \u201CAs if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always <em>hated</em> cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\u2019t let me hear the name again!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI won\u2019t indeed!\u201D said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. \u201CAre you\u2060 \u2014 are you fond\u2060\u2014of \u2060\u2014 of dogs?\u201D The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \u201CThere is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\u2019ll fetch things when you throw them, and it\u2019ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things \u2060\u2014 I can\u2019t remember half of them\u2060 \u2014 and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it\u2019s so useful, it\u2019s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and \u2060\u2014 oh dear!\u201D cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, \u201CI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve offended it again!\u201D For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p>",8),f=o("p",null,"So she called softly after it, \u201CMouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u201D When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \u201CLet us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell you my history, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u201D",-1),p=o("p",null,"It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.
